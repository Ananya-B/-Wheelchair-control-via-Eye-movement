# -Wheelchair-control-via-Eye-movement
The purpose of this project is to design a prototype of a wheelchair which can help differently abled individuals move independently. The motion of the wheelchair is controlled via the subjectâ€™s eye movement using IR sensors. The eye tracking-based technology employs the use of Infrared (IR) sensor modules, that are mounted on an eye frame to trace the movement of the iris. Since, IR sensors detect only white objects a unique sequence of digital bits is generated corresponding to each eye movement. These signals are then processed via a micro controller to control the motors of the wheelchair. The potential and efficiency of previously developed rehabilitation systems that use head motion, chin control, sip-n-puff control, voice recognition, and EEG signals variedly have also been explored in detail. They were found to be inconvenient as they served either limited usability or non-affordability. After multiple regression analyses, the proposed design was developed as a cost-effective, flexible and stream-lined alternative for people who have trouble adopting conventional assistive technologies.
